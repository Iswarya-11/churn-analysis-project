# Customer Churn Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. 
The goal is to help businesses identify potential customers who are likely to leave, 
allowing proactive measures to retain them.

## Project Features
- **Data Analysis:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand customer behavior.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, scale data.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implemented models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest.
- **Prediction:** Predict whether a customer is likely to churn.
- **Visualization:** Graphs and charts to understand patterns in customer churn.
